Radicale CalDAV and CardDAV server
==================================

The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server.  It
aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to configure.
As a consequence, it requires few software dependances and is pre-configured to
work out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD,
MacOS X) and Windows.  It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning, iPhone
and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL
version 3.

For further information, please visit the `Radicale Website
<http://www.radicale.org/>`_.
