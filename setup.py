Radicale CalDAV server
======================

The Radicale Project is a CalDAV calendar server.  It aims to be a light
solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to configure.  As a consequence,
it requires few software dependances and is pre-configured to work
out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD,
MacOS X) and Windows.  It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning, iPhone
and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL
version 3.

For further information, please visit the `Radicale Website
