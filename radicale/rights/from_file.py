"""
File-based rights.

The owner is implied to have all rights on their collections.

Rights are read from a file whose name is specified in the config 
(section "right", key "file").

The file's format is per line:

collectionpath ":" principal " " rights {", " principal " " rights}*

collectionpath is the path part of the collection's url

principal is a user name (no whitespace allowed)
rights is a string w/o whitespace that contains "r" for reading rights, 
"w" for writing rights and a combination of these for all rights.

Empty lines are ignored. Lines starting with "#" (hash sign) are comments.

Example:

# This means user1 may read, user2 may write, user3 has full access
/user0/calendar : user1 r, user2 w, user3 rw
# user0 can read /user1/cal
/user1/cal : user0 r 

If a collection /a/b is shared and other users than the owner are 
supposed to find the collection in a propfind request, an additional
line for /a has to be in the defintions. E.g.:

/user0/cal: user
