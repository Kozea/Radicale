File-based rights.

The owner is implied to have all rights on their collections.

Rights are read from a file whose name is specified in the config (section
"right", key "file").

Example:

# This means user1 may read, user2 may write, user3 has full access
[/user0/calendar]
user1: r
user2: w
user3: rw

# user0 can read /user1/cal
[/user1/cal]
user0: r

# If a collection /a/b is shared and other users than the owner are supposed to
# find the collection in a propfind request, an additional line for /a has to
# be in the defintions. E.g.:

[/user0]
user1: r
