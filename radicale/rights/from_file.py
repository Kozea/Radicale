"""
Rights backend based on a regex-based file whose name is specified in the
config (section "rights", key "file").

The login is matched against the "user" key, and the collection path
is matched against the "collection" key. In the "collection" regex you can use
`{user}` and get groups from the "user" regex with `{0}`, `{1}`, etc.
In consequence of the parameter substitution you have to write `{{` and `}}`
if you want to use regular curly braces in the "user" and "collection" regexes.

For example, for the "user" key, ".+" means "authenticated user" and ".*"
means "anybody" (including anonymous users).

Section names are only used for naming the rule.

Leading or ending slashes are trimmed from collection's path.
