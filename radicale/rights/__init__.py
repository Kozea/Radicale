"""
The rights module used to determine if a user can read and/or write
collections and entries.

Permissions:

  - R: read collections (excluding address books and calendars)
  - r: read address book and calendar collections
  - i: subset of **r** that only allows direct access via HTTP method GET
       (CalDAV/CardDAV is susceptible to expensive search requests)
  - W: write collections (excluding address books and calendars)
  - w: write address book and calendar collections

Take a look at the class ``BaseRights`` if you want to implement your own.
