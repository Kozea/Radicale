Authentication management.

Default is htpasswd authentication.

Apache's htpasswd command (httpd.apache.org/docs/programs/htpasswd.html)
manages a file for storing user credentials. It can encrypt passwords using
different methods, e.g. BCRYPT, MD5-APR1 (a version of MD5 modified for
Apache), SHA1, or by using the system's CRYPT routine. The CRYPT and SHA1
encryption methods implemented by htpasswd are considered as insecure. MD5-APR1
provides medium security as of 2015. Only BCRYPT can be considered secure by
current standards.

MD5-APR1-encrypted credentials can be written by all versions of htpasswd (it
is the default, in fact), whereas BCRYPT requires htpasswd 2.4.x or newer.

The `is_authenticated(user, password)` function provided by this module
verifies the user-given credentials by parsing the htpasswd credential file
pointed to by the ``htpasswd_filename`` configuration value while assuming
the password encryption method specified via the ``htpasswd_encryption``
configuration value.

The following htpasswd password encrpytion methods are supported by Radicale
out-of-the-box:

    - plain-text (created by htpasswd -p...) -- INSECURE
    - CRYPT      (created by htpasswd -d...) -- INSECURE
    - SHA1       (created by htpasswd -s...) -- INSECURE

When passlib (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passlib) is importable, the
following significantly more secure schemes are parsable by Radicale:

    - MD5-APR1   (htpasswd -m...) -- htpasswd's default method
    - BCRYPT     (htpasswd -B...) -- Requires htpasswd 2.4.x
