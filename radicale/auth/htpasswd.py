"""
Authentication backend that checks credentials with a htpasswd file.

Apache's htpasswd command (httpd.apache.org/docs/programs/htpasswd.html)
manages a file for storing user credentials. It can encrypt passwords using
different the methods BCRYPT or MD5-APR1 (a version of MD5 modified for
Apache). MD5-APR1 provides medium security as of 2015. Only BCRYPT can be
considered secure by current standards.

MD5-APR1-encrypted credentials can be written by all versions of htpasswd (it
is the default, in fact), whereas BCRYPT requires htpasswd 2.4.x or newer.

The `is_authenticated(user, password)` function provided by this module
verifies the user-given credentials by parsing the htpasswd credential file
pointed to by the ``htpasswd_filename`` configuration value while assuming
the password encryption method specified via the ``htpasswd_encryption``
configuration value.

The following htpasswd password encrpytion methods are supported by Radicale
out-of-the-box:

    - plain-text (created by htpasswd -p...) -- INSECURE
    - MD5-APR1   (htpasswd -m...) -- htpasswd's default method

When passlib[bcrypt] is installed:

    - BCRYPT     (htpasswd -B...) -- Requires htpasswd 2.4.x
